His campaign has been described as “openly authoritarian,” marked by calls to terminate the U.S. Constitution and promised retribution against his political opponents. He has even gone so far as to claim that he wants to become “a dictator on day one.” His supporters are fervent, as are his opponents, and many believe a second nonconsecutive Trump term is a distinct possibility.</p>",
