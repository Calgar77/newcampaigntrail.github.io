He soon found luck in the business of law and passed the bar in 1929, and in 1936, was elected to the House of Representatives. Having served in the Senate since 1944, he would certainly add additional gravitas to the ticket that few others could give, along with being a stalwart ally and supporter of many of your policies, he's a great personal pick for you. Being on the Senate Commerce Committee, combined with Henry Jackson lobbying for him as running mate, he commands great respect among his colleagues, and could certainly help you get bills passed while President.<p>That being said, Maggie - as he's nicknamed - does little to expand your outreach, blocking off the path of moderates, and is certainly no olive branch to the South. By selecting him, you'd be making a risky play in trying to combat Nixon on his own home turf, while trying to retain a thin coalition of moderates and core supporters.",
